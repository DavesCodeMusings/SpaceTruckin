In this stage of the build, we're still concentrating on the look of the
game and nothing has been done to make it playable.  Work in this section
is mainly done in the CSS file and some in the HTML file.  If you've ever
had an app that is 'skinable', meaning you can easily change the look of
it, you have a good understanding of the use of CSS.

HTML deals with the structure, while CSS deals with the look.  With only
about 50 lines of CSS, we can make the mockup of the game look a whole
lot better.

We'll also swap out the image of the solar system for one of Earth since
that is the current location of our ship.

We're still concentrating on the mobile design and things won't look
right in a full-screen desktop until a later phase of the design.

In a work setting, this is refered to as a 'minimum viable product',
meaning that it's just enough to get by.  If this were an app used by
people out in the field, on mobile phones and tablets, it might just be
good enough.  If it will be used on laptops, we can add those features
as needed.
