In this stage of the project, we are putting together a mockup of what we
expect the game to look like in the end.  This will give potential players
of our game a good idea of what they can expect, as early as possible.

All of the work has been done within the HTML file.  CSS and Javascript will
come into play eventually, but this is where we'll start.  We're also
starting our design on a mobile platform.  If you look at the screenshot,
it's a simulation of how things would look on an older model iPhone.

This is far from a working design.  It's more of a sketch, but it has some
of the basics already incorporated and some of the controls actually work.
For example, you can open up the news heading to see the message that's
waiting.  We'll be improving upon this sketch in the next few phases.

In a work setting this is important, because it gives your customer (whomever
you're designing the software for) a chance to suggest changes before too
much time is spent developing the software.  Time is money, as they say, so
any time saved is money in the bank.
