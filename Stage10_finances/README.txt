Adding the randomized news headlines in the last stage wasn't too difficult
and it added a sense of realism and maybe some humor that players might
appreciate.  This time around, we'll be adding some of that realism to the
financial aspect of the game. In particular, a bank account that pays
interest and a credit account that charges interest. And as life goes, the
interest you pay is almost always higher than the interest you receive.

Another thing that will make game play more challenging is to make the bank
available only on Earth. This means the player will have to think ahead to
ensure they have enough cash on hand to make any purchases in ports besides
Earth. There is no interest to be gained on cash, so players must strike a
balance.

Start thinking about what we've been doing with JavaScript variables as
data models and JavaScript functions to display the data. See if you can
come up with some ideas for modeling and presenting these changes to the
player's view of the game.

And, just for fun, take a look at the screenshot to see what a trip around
the solar system can do to your finances.
