In the previous stage of our mockup design we added CSS to correct some
minor flaws in the design.  In the end, we doubled the number of lines in
the CSS file to just about 100.  The result is a good looking mockup of
the game's mobile presentation.  But what about desktops?

It's entirely possible that someone may want to play our game on a laptop,
desktop, or tablet computer.  These devices have a lot more usable screen
area.  They also tend to have screens that are wider than they are tall.

Switching out of mobile emulation in the web browser quickly shows that
the mockup we have now is definitely not ready for big, wide screens.
Just look at the before screenshot to see what a disaster it is.  In this
stage of the build, we will work on correcting that.

We'll be using CSS to do most of the work, but we'll also get into a
little bit of JavaScript.  While HTML provides the structure of our game,
and CSS provides the look, JavaScript takes care of the programming logic.
If you're not a programmer, don't panic, we'll start small.
