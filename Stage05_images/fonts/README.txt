Fonts

Plain old HTML is pretty boring with only three basic fonts built
in: serif, sans-serif, and monospaced. Fortunately these can be
extended with add-ins.

One of my favorite places to find open-licensed fonts is at the
Font Library web site. https://fontlibrary.org/

The font that caught my eye for this game is called Xolonium, and
it would look right at home on the cover of any Science Fiction
novel. https://fontlibrary.org/en/font/xolonium

The Open Type (OTF) version of the font is what we'll use for the
game. Titles will use bold. Other text will use regular.
