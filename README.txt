Space Truckin'
--------------

Space Truckin' is a simple web-based strategy game. Its purpose is to teach
the art of html, css, and javascript coding in a fun way.

The concept for the game comes from an old Apple II game from 1982 called
'Taipan!' https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taipan! Gameplay involves visiting
one of seven ports in the South China Sea, buying and selling goods, and
hoping to make a profit. Along the way, you fight off pirates, and get
caught up in dangerous storms that sometimes blow you off course. As you
play, you also get opportunity to purchase bigger and better ships, as well
as cannons to fight off those pirates.

Space Truckin' gameplay extends to the Solar System. The ports of call are
updated to include: Earth, Luna (Earth's moon,) Venus, Mars, Ceres (largest
object in the asteroid belt,) Ganymede (largest moon of Jupiter,) and Titan
(the largest moon of Saturn.)

There will still be pirate and mauraders as well as solar storms to send
players off course. Sailing ships are replaced by space ships with solar
sails. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solar_sail  Cannons are replaced with
rail guns. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Railgun
