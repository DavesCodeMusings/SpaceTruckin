This game uses images from NASA (nasa.gov)

NASA is funded by US taxpayers and the legal terms for using their images
fall under what is termed "public domain". This means we do not have to
pay a license fee or royalty since we, as taxpayers, already paid the bill.

There are other terms that NASA requires. One is that we cannot use their
logo or the name NASA to advertise our game. But, since it's a free game,
that's not really a problem.

All image editing is done using the free and open-source GNU Image
Manipulation Program (The GIMP) https://www.gimp.org/


Here are links to the NASA images used in the game. In all instances, I've
downloaded the high-resolution TIFF images. This file type offers better
quality than JPEG and is compatible with The GIMP editor.
