    <p>To my favorite family member in the galaxy...</p>
    <p>
      I hope this card finds you well. I heard you just graduated college.
      Congratulations, kid! I wish you luck finding a job. I know times ain't
      the greatest right now and the economy's in tough shape. But, you're
      smart and I know you'll pull through.
    </p>
    <p>
      Your mom & dad might have told you that I've decided to sign on with the
      UAC Space Marines on Mars. I'll be manning the outpost on Phobos, which
      should be a total cake walk. Nothing exciting ever happens on Phobos.
    </p>
    <p>
      Your parents may have also told you I've got an old solar sail freighter
      tucked away in storage from my time with the merchant fleet. She's not
      big, but she's a good ship.
    </p>
    <p>
      I'll be on deployment for two years with an option to re-up if things
      work out. While I'm gone, the freighter is yours. Last I checked, there
      were still about twenty crates of electronics in the hold. Maybe you
      can sell some of it and pay off your student loan.
    </p>
    <p>
      Speaking of dinero, kid, look inside the envelope. I slipped a ten spot
      in there for you. It's not a lot, but maybe you can buy yourself a
      graduation burger or something.
    </p>
    <p>
      Best of luck in whatever you decide to do.
