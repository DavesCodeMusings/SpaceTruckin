    <h2>About</h2>
    <p>
      SpaceTruckin' was created out of a desire for learning during COVID-19 quarantine. It's a web-based game that is
      built in, small easy to tackle stages. The game itself is similar to an old Apple II game I used to play, called
      <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taipan!" target="_blank">Taipan!</a> Inspiration for the title comes from
      <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6JRL1TdK1Bg" target="_blank">a classic tune by Deep Purple</a>.
    </p>
    <p>
      I've broken the game into stages as I've been building and documented each one with a README.txt file explaining
      what's going on. My hope is to add some video instructions once it's all done.
    </p>

      <a href="demo/index.html">Click here to play the latest working demo</a>. Keep in mind, this is not a
      finished product and the demo version will change as enhancements are made.
    </p>

    <h2>What will you learn?</h2>
    <p>
      If you decide to follow along with the development process of the game, here are a few things you will learn about
      along the way:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>How to build web pages with HTML, CSS and JavaScript.</li>
      <li>Ways to enhance your pages with images and custom fonts.</li>
      <li>How to make your web pages work on mobile platforms like phones and tablets.</li>
      <li>Using a rapid and iterative development process gets results quickly.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>What do you need to get started?</h2>
    <p>
      Space Truckin' requires nothing more than a plain old text editor. Honest. Everything can be written in Notepad if
      you want. I've used Microsoft's free to download tool, <a href="https://code.visualstudio.com/"
        target="_blank">Visual Studio Code</a>, but alternatives are <a href="https://notepad-plus-plus.org/"
        target="blank">Notepad++</a> and a host of other code editors available on the internet.
    </p>
    <p>
      Unfortunately, I am not familiar with code editor offerings on MacOS or ChromeOS, but I hope to add them soon.

      no warranty, nor is there a guaranty of fitness for any particular purpose.</p>

    <p>Space Truckin' is not associated with, nor is it endorsed by, Deep Purple, but it sure would make a cool
      soundtrack.</p>
