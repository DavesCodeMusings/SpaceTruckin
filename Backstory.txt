To my favorite family member in the galaxy...

I hope this card finds you well. I heard you just graduated college.
Congratulations, kid. I wish you luck finding a job. I know times ain't
the greatest right now and the economy's in tough shape. But, you're
smart and I know you'll pull through.

Your mom & dad might have told you that I've decided to sign on with the
UAC Space Marines on Mars. I'll be manning the outpost on Phobos, which
should be a total cake walk. Nothing exciting ever happens on Phobos.
Your parents may have also told you I've got an old solar sail freighter
tucked away in storage from my time with the merchant fleet. She's not
big, but she's a good ship.

I'll be on deployment for a year with an option to re-up if things
work out. While I'm gone, the freighter is yours if you want her. Last
I checked there were still about twenty crates of electronics in the
hold. Maybe you can sell it and pay off your student loan.

By the way, kid, check inside the envelope. I slipped a ten spot in
there for you. It's not a lot, but maybe you can buy yourself a
graduation burger or something.

Best of luck in whatever you decide to do.
Crazy Uncle Mike
